Easy marking:

Units: rows, columns, boxes.
Moves: row/col [rook], knight, king, box.

* For each marked instance of the number, clear out all rows, columns, boxes,
knight's moves, king's moves.  Clear also all adjacents for adjacent integers.

The hard part:

* If all possible locations for a number in a unit
  can "see" a particular other square in another unit, then that other square
  can be eliminated.

  How to do it for a target number:

    For each type of unit
      For each instance of that unit
        Locate all possibilities A for the number in that unit.
        For all possibilities b for the number outside that unit
          If all of A can see b
            reject b

  TODO: Does this include all the inferences we can make, using the adjacency
  rule as well?  Not sure, but speculation should probably cover it.

Easy recursion:

* Speculating: choose a number for a square, and run all the above rules; if the
  board contains a contradiction, then that possibility can be eliminated.

Easy check.
* Contradiction check: if a number cannot appear in a unit, or if
  it appears twice in the unit, reject the configuration.  Probably don't even
  need the "twice" check, if we speculate only within the realm of legality

To generate all knight/king moves, iterate over the offsets, then check if
they're in ([0, 8], [0, 8]).  To generate rows/cols, just set row/col to the
number and iterate 0-8 on the other.  To generate box, use div/mod to get the
top-left coord of the box, then add 0-2 to each coord.

Knight's moves [as deltas]:
  let moves = []
  for (let one of [-1, 1]) {
    for (let two of [-2, 2]) {
      moves.push([one, two], [two, one])
    }
  }

King's moves [as deltas]:
  let moves = []
  for (let dr of [-1, 0, 1]) {
    for (let dc of [-1, 0, 1]) {
      if (dr || dc) {
        moves.push([dc, dr])
      }
    }
  }

Rook's and box moves aren't deltas.

Or, maybe simpler as Haskell:

sees :: Coord -> Coord -> Boolean
sees p0 p1 = isKnightsMove p0 p1 || isKingsMove p0 p1 ||
             row p0 == row p1 || col p0 == col p1

Make the board be a Set (col, row, Int); if there are multiple entries with
the same col + row, they have different numbers, and are the current
possibilities for that coord.

Hmm...or Map (col, row) (Set Int), which is a bit cleaner.

Start with a full board, then set the starting conditions by clearing out the
coords of the given numbers.  Then do the 'can p0 see p1' to clear out all
the basics for each solved one.

Interior check, to be iterated until nothing changes: -- Now called clearSolved.
  For each number N
    For each unit U
      let S = all the possible places in U that N can be
      if size S == 1
        let c = head S
         if size (board ! c) != 1
            set board ! c to Set.singleton N

Exterior check:
  For each number N
    For each unit U
      let S = all the possible places in U that N can be
      let L = all the locations NOT in U that N can be
      -- So filter all sets that have N as possible, then partition into S,L.
      clear N from $ filter (all S see) l
