This is a quick-and-dirty solver for the "impossible" sudoku at
https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/897LqtfTQD.  I recommend trying it
yourself or watching one of their excellent videos about the solving experience,
starting with this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4

Don't look here for clean code or great idiomatic Haskell; I'm no Haskell
expert, and was just playing around.
